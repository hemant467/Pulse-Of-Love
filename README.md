# 💖 Pulse Of Love 💘
A mathematical heart 💝 that beats with every pulse. Animated in MATLAB, this project blends equations, curves, and love into a visual Valentine. Watch love and math collide in motion! ❤️‍🔥.

An animated mathematical heart built in MATLAB — where equations beat, curves breathe, and code becomes a Valentine.

A creative fusion of mathematics, animation, and emotion.

HeartBeat-MATLAB is a creative MATLAB animation that visualizes a living, breathing heart using mathematical functions and dynamic animation.

It’s not just a plot — it’s an expression.
A Valentine written in code, curves, and calculus.

This project blends:

  - Mathematical beauty
  - Signal-like animation
  - Romantic visual design

Perfect for:

  - Valentine’s Day surprises 💌
  - MATLAB visualization demos
  - Math + art inspiration
  - Showing that engineers have feelings too 😉

🎥 What It Does:

  - Generates a heart-shaped curve using mathematical equations
  - Animates the curve using a sinusoidal modulation
  - Creates a heartbeat-like motion
  - Uses a gold background with a glowing red heart
  - Runs in a continuous animation loop for a smooth visual experience

🧠 Mathematical Insight:

The heart shape is formed by combining:

  - A cube-root based curve for smooth symmetry
  - A sine function for rhythmic animation
  - A square-root boundary to maintain shape integrity

Together, these create a visually pleasing and emotionally expressive animation — proof that math can be romantic.

🛠️ Requirements:

  - MATLAB (R2018a or newer recommended)
  - No additional toolboxes required

🚀 How to Run

# Option 1: Clone the original repo

If you just want a local copy of Hemant’s repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hemant467/Pulse-Of-Love.git
```

This will download all files, including your `valentine code explanation.m`. After cloning, you can navigate to the file:

```bash
cd Pulse-Of-Love/Code📟
```

# Option 2: Add the original repo as a remote

If you already have a local repository and want to link it to the original repo (for pulling updates or reference):

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/hemant467/Pulse-Of-Love.git
```

  - `origin` → usually points to your repo
  - `upstream` → points to the original source repo

Then you can pull updates from the original repo anytime:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

(replace `main` with the branch name if it’s different)

4. Sit back and let the heart beat ❤️

# 💝 Why This Project?

Because:

  - Math isn’t cold ❄️
  - Code isn’t emotionless
  - And love can absolutely be expressed in MATLAB

This project is a reminder that creativity and logic can coexist beautifully.
